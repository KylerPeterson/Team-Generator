# Team-Generator
A very simple team generator I made in my free time practicing Python. <br> 
The way to use the team generator on this version is when you run it you will be prompted to enter names <br>
After entering all of the names desired type in an "x" when prompted again, then shortly it will provide two teams with the names provided at random
